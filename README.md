# learning-journal
You’ve been creating your learning journal entries so far using a shared journal I have created for you. It’s time now to make your own version.  You’ll be spending quite a bit of time looking at this journal, so you might as well make it look nice and behave well. To that end, I want you to make a mockup of the site in HTML and CSS.
